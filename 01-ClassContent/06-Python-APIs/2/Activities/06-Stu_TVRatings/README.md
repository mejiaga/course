### TV Ratings

In this activity, you will create an application that reads in a list of TV shows, makes multiple requests from an API to retrieve rating information, creates a pandas dataframe, and a visually displays the data.

## Instructions:

* You may use the list provided in the starter file or create your own.

* Request information from the TVmaze API's Show Search endpoint (<https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-search>) on each show and store the name and rating information into lists.

* Put this data into a dictionary, and load that dict into a Pandas DataFrame.

* Use matplotlib to create a bar chart comparing the ratings of each show.
