# Mine the Subqueries

## Instructions

1. Using subqueries, identify all actors who appear in the film _Alter Victory_ in the `sakila` database.

2. Using subqueries, display the titles of films that the employee, Jon Stephens, rented to customers.

## Bonus

* For problem No. 2, refine the Jon Stephens query to select for films that were rented on May 31st, and whose titles begin with the letter **C**.

* Hint: you may wish to look into using **wildcards** in MySQL.
