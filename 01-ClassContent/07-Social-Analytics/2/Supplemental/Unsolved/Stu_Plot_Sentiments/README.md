# Now Plot it out

Sentiment Analysis is already crazy fun, but how can we visualize it? In this exercise we will do just that!

## Instructions

Using Jupyter Notebook we are going to run sentiment analysis on "@SouthwestAir".

On top of you regular analysis, you should also keep track of how many tweets ago was it tweeted.

Next store our results into a pandas DataFrame and read results.

Finally create a plot with the follow labels.

* Title as "Sentiment Analysis of Tweet (`date`) for `Twitter Handle`.

* Y label as "Tweet Polarity"

* X label as "Tweets Ago"
