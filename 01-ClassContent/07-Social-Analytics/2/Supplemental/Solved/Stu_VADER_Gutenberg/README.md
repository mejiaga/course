## Sentiment, I am your analysis

Your turn to run a VADER analysis.

### Instructions

* Open and read the given three sample text.

* For each sample print out the "compound", "positive", "neutral" and "negative" score for each.

### HINTS

* Start with reading files and printing them. Once you have this, treat the files as if they were in your script the entire time. (What would be good to do this?)
