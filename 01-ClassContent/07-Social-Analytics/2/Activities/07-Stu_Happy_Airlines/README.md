# Frequent Twitter Miles

Airlines get a lot of flack on Twitter, especially from celebrities and cultural icons. Let's see what tone the average Twitter user strikes when tweeting about them.

### Instructions

* Retrieve and run a VADER sentiment analysis on 1000 tweets for each of the 7 popular airlines.

* Create an empty list to hold the results from each airline.

* Filter the tweets using the conditional filter variables provided.

* Create a "sentiment" dictionary for each airline that includes the search term and the averages of the compound, neutral, positive, and negative scores. Print this dictionary and append it to a list holding each airline's results.

* Create a DataFrame to display the results.

### HINTS

* Start with a subset of data for each airline while testing. Be sure that your code works with only one or two pages. Once you feel your code is correct, then, adapt your code to collect all 1000 tweets per airline.
