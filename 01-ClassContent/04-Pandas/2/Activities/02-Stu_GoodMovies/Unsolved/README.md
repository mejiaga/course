# We Like Good Movies

## Instructions

1. Use Pandas to load and display the CSV provided in `Resources`.

2. List all the columns in the data set.

3. We're only interested in IMDb data, so create a new table that takes the Film and all the columns relating to IMDB.

4. Filter out only the good movies—i.e., any film with an IMDb score greater than or equal to 7.

5. Find less popular movies that you may not have heard about in 2015 - i.e., anything with under 20K votes

6. Finally, export this file to a spreadsheet, excluding the index, so we can keep track of our future watchlist.
