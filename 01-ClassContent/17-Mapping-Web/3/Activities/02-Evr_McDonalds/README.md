# Our First CARTO Map Solved

In this activity, we created our first map using CARTO as a class.

## Instructions

* Once you're logged into CARTO for the first time, you should be presented with the following screen:

  ![New Map](Images/01-New-Map.png)

* Click on `New Map` then `Connect Data-set`.

* Click the `Browse` button and upload the [McDonalds GeoJSON CSV](Resources/mcdonaldsgeojson.csv), press submit, and finally click `Connect Dataset`.

  * Note: CARTO also supports Shapefiles, another popular geospatial data format.

  * CARTO also allows you to automatically sync your data every hour/day/month so your maps can stay up to date if you have a dynamic dataset. No need to change this setting for now.

* You should be navigated to your newly created map:

* Now follow these steps to navigate to the Data View:

  * Click the icon inside the McDonald's Layer item.

  * Go back to map view and click on the "Style" option on the left sidebar. Select the "blending" option and chose the color burn setting. This will intensify color where there is a higher McDonald's density.

  * If you'd like to adjust the colors of the markers with the color-burn option on, you can still select a base solid color from the same menu.
