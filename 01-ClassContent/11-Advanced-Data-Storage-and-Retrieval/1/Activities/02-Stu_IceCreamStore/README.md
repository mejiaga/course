### Instructions

* Create a database `icecream_db`

* Connect to icecream_db in MySQL Workbench.

* Create a table `icecreamstore` of 5 or more ice cream flavors, each of which should have a rating out of 100, and price (make sure that a few cost $1.25).

* Query your table in MySQL Workbench for every flavor of ice cream.

* Query your table in MySQL Workbench for all flavors that cost 1.25.

* Next, create a Python script that uses SQLAlchemy to accomplish all of the above steps.
